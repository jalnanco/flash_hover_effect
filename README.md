- React

### React

Scratch-Off is not part of any package management system.
To use the component, include the file directly in your project and then import the component using `import ScratchOff from './path_to_file'`. You can then use Scratch-Off like a normal React component.

```html
<ScratchOff
  width="100"
  height="100"
  background="photo1.png"
  foreground="photo2.png"
/>
```
